    "Has the production of Slice of Life anime passed Shounen anime from 1990 to 2025 and if so when did this trend start? The trend is defined as the annual ratio of genre-specific releases worldwide to total releases."

    "Popular media is a reflection of the interests of the majority and changes over time and place through the influence of culture and environment. Trends can arise when certain genres attract a significant following and creators appeal to this interest, leading to increased production in media with common themes. In terms of anime, two genres that have had a consistently large following and interest are shonen and slice-of-life. Many iconic anime fall under the shonen genre such as Naruto and Dragon Ball and are usually characterized by action and fantasy themes. Similarly, figures from slice-of-life anime such as Lucky Star and Love Live have become easily recognizable from their long-standing popularity and are characterized by lighthearted and relatable stories. With shonen and slice-of-life being popular genres in Japanese media for a long time, we wanted to better understand any potential changes in production between anime of these two genres over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many shonen series first find their start by having a chapter published in the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine before being compiled into a full manga. The target audience of this magazine is usually teen and young adult boys, which is seen through the frequent use of male protagonists who reflect this audience. The article “The Rise and Fall of Weekly Shonen Jump: A Look at the Circulation of Weekly Jump” focuses on the amount of sales of the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1970 to 2005 and takes note of its peak popularity and when it begins to decline <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a>. Observing sales of the magazine, it began its height of popularity in 1993 but “…between 1995 and 2005, while other magazines' sales stayed fairly constant, Shonen Jump's circulation decreased dramatically” <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a>. At the same time, competing magazines like Weekly Shonen Magazine also found a slight decline in sales around a similar time period <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a>. Comparing this change in sales to the titles in the editions of this time, the decrease in sales coincides with the ending of popular series like Dragon Ball <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a>. This study was done in 2007 and only observes sales up to 2005. Additionally, the data solely focuses on the popularity of titles being published through this particular magazine, which may not reflect titles in other magazines or other platforms like television.\n",

    "In “Trends of Fiction in 2000s Japanese Pop Culture” published in the Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies, Motoko Tanaka studies the fall of “the fictional age” (kyokō no jidai) and the beginning of “the age of impossibility” zeitgeists in Japan, along with how that change correlated with the rise and fall of certain anime genres popular among teen-young adult Japanese men <a href=\"#ref2\">[2]</a>. Tanaka argues that the 1970–1995 “fictional age,” which was heralded in by the failure of the Anpo and Zenkyōtō student activism movements, was defined by the desire of young Japanese men to “…seek ideals not in political movements and changes in the real world, but rather in imagined settings such as theme parks and in fictional characters” <a href=\"#ref2\">[2]</a>. While the article doesn’t directly mention shonen anime being popular, it can be logically inferred that anime with strong, morally just male protagonists in fantasy settings fit this cultural desire. Tanaka then discusses the fall of the “fictional age” and the beginning of \"the age of impossibility,” influenced by catastrophes such as the 1995 Kobe Earthquake, the Aum sarin gas attack, and 9/11, as well as Japan’s ‘lost decade’ <a href=\"#ref2\">[2]</a>. During this period, more optimistic genres such as traditional shonen saw a decline in prominence, while darker genres such as Sekaikei and Sabaibukei (death game narratives) gained attention <a href=\"#ref2\">[2]</a>. Tanaka also notes that, during the late 2000s, Nichijōkei (slice-of-life) anime began to surge in popularity <a href=\"#ref2\">[2]</a>. Although the paper focuses more on cultural analysis than statistical evidence and is limited mainly to the 1990s–2000s, it still identifies clear genre trends and their cultural context, which helped inform our hypothesis.\n",

    "A more recent study that focused more on data analysis was performed by Research and Markets, with their results being presented in the article “United States Anime Genres Market Analysis Report 2025: Rise of Isekai and Fantasy Genres - Competition, Trends, Forecasts & Opportunities, 2020–2030” <a href=\"#ref3\">[3]</a>. This article summarizes current trends in the anime industry and predicts future trends and growth, with a focus on the American market. It states that the U.S. anime market has grown significantly due to the rise of streaming services, merchandise growth, and expanding demographic appeal, with the market expected to double by 2030 <a href=\"#ref3\">[3]</a>. It also states that, while shonen and slice-of-life anime continue to be extremely popular genres, they are no longer at the very top. Instead, fantasy and particularly isekai genres are now dominant, influenced by the success of series like Sword Art Online <a href=\"#ref3\">[3]</a>. While the article provides market growth data and industry projections, it does not provide detailed genre-specific statistics and is limited to the 2020s–2030s timeframe.\n",

    "We believe that Slice of Life anime production experienced explosive growth while Shounen production experienced a plateau/drop starting around the year 2000. Shounen was extremely popular around 1990 to the early 2000s. However, starting in the year 2000 we believe that simpler storylines that follow easily digestible characters and lack action have become more popular. We expect to observe an inverse relationship between the production rate of Shounen and Slice of Life worldwide with an intersection point around the year 2000."

    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data used to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> Older anime are less likely to be recorded in modern dataset, especially for more niche anime. The genre tagging process could also be biased as there are no purely objective definitions of the genres.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> Even though our dataset does not include any confidential data, we will ensure data integrity and up-to-date software. We need data integrity and up-to-date software to enable reproducibility of our experiments.\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> No, since we do not have ownership of the dataset, we cannot delete the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> Although direct engagement with production studios is not feasible, we sought to address blindspots by reviewing community tagging documentation to fully understand the possible bias behind genre tagging.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> Older anime are less likely to be recorded in modern dataset, especially for more niche anime. The genre tagging process could also be biased as there are no purely objective definitions of the genres. We admit these biases, but they are beyond our ability to address. If we were to address them, we would ask different people to vote on the genre of each anime. Since there are more than 10,000 anime in the dataset, such an approach would not be feasible for the timeline of this project.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We recognize that it is nearly impossible to have a completely unbiased representation of the underlying data. We will cross check each others’ works to ensure that a minimum amount of bias is achieved throughout the project. We will also note unresolvable biases that may occur in our analysis in the report.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> Yes, we will document all the details of our analysis to ensure its auditability. We will also use a fixed timeframe (eg. 1990~2025) to avoid ambiguity in the dataset as it is being updated daily to include the newest anime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> Though the dataset is being analyzed from a non-Japanese perspective, the data itself is largely representative of English-speaking anime audience as a whole, and thus we want our analysis to focus on that and limit anything that would be particularly discriminatory (ie specific regions or areas)\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We are factoring in disparate error via limiting the amount of ‘groups’ we are analyzing, as our model largely wants to hone in on similarly sized, comparable media genres for best prediction\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We understand that the model is training on Japanese media using English-speaking audiences and their data, and thus may not be the most optimal predictor of what Japanese audiences and companies’ decisions end up being\n",
    "\n",

    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Monitoring the model over time according to future trends compared to our fixed timeframe (as rating is largely skewed by modern audiences’ tastes compared to more dated media) and checking if the conclusions made now still apply in the future\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> Properly outlining/defining what the model is primarily for would be the biggest step in preventing unintended usage, especially as a policy or disclaimer for usage\n"

    "* Communication will primarily be done using Discord (we have our own server)\n",
    "* Usual tone when discussing things should be casual, polite, and friendly unless something serious comes up (like a divisive conflict in opinion between members), in which case politeness should still be maintained\n",
    "* Decisions should be made unanimously by the group\n",
    "* Each person will focus on a specific task/aspect of the project (different parts of the writing, EDA, preprocessing, visualizations, etc.), with tasks only being assigned with the person’s full knowledge and consent. However, it is expected for everyone to collaborate and keep in touch with each other’s work so that everyone has a full picture of what is happening. \n",
    "* Keep an updated and fair project timeline so that everyone knows what they are doing\n",
    "* If a person ends up not being able to do a task or wants to do something else, the group can arrange a swap of who does what. This will probably be arranged in Discord and people can bring up their issues during either a weekly meeting or by just typing in the chat. The person with the issue should contact the group ASAP. The group can have one of the other members complete the work for the person with the issue, while the person with the issue will be assigned more work in some other part of the project to make sure they are still doing their part.\n",
    "* If one or more members believe that someone isn’t putting in the work that they should be doing, they should try and make their concerns heard by the problematic member via either a private message on Discord or Email. If the issues persist or if the problematic member becomes/continues to be more difficult to work with, the member should inform the rest of the group and from there they can decide what to do about the problem.\n"
